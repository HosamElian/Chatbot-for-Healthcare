## 💡 Project Overview

Modern healthcare settings generate vast amounts of data—clinical records, guidelines, and research papers—that are difficult to manually analyze in real-time. This chatbot bridges that gap by providing **semantic search**, **document summarization**, and **interactive dialogue**, empowering healthcare professionals with accurate, context-aware answers and actionable insights.

The chatbot utilizes:
- **LlamaIndex** for document indexing and semantic data retrieval  
- **Google Gemini API** for natural language understanding and generation  
- **Vector embedding** to enhance document comprehension  
- **HTML/CSS** for a clean and user-friendly interface  
- **SQLite** for efficient and lightweight database management
